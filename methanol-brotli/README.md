# methanol-brotli

Provides [brotli][brotli] decompression.

## Installation

### Gradle

```gradle
implementation 'com.github.mizosoft.methanol:methanol-brotli:1.4.1'
```

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.mizosoft.methanol</groupId>
  <artifactId>methanol-brotli</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Implementation notes

The Java brotli decoder provided by Google only exposes `InputStream` APIs. It cannot be used
to implement a non-blocking `BodyDecoder`. The C implementation is used instead through JNI
bindings (also provided by Google). To allow multi-platform support, native libraries for each
supported OS X Architecture are bundled with the JAR and extracted to a temp directory on use.

### Supported platforms

| OS       | x86 | x64 | Tool Chain   | Tested Machines     |
|----------|-----|-----|--------------|---------------------|
| Windows  | ✔   | ✔  | Visual C++   | Windows 10 & CI   |
| Linux    | ✔   | ✔  | GCC 9.2.1    | Ubuntu 19.10 & CI |
| Mac OS   | ❌  | ❌ |              |                     |

### Building from source

You can build from source if your platform is not supported. The build routine uses Gradle's
[native software plugin][gradle_native_plugin]. You need to have a tool chain that's
[supported by gradle][gradle_supported_toolchains] for your OS.

#### Steps

After cloning this repo, run gradle with the `installBrotli` and `assemble` tasks:

`gradlew installBrotli :methanol-brotli:assemble`

This builds the native libraries and copies them to `src/main/resources` for inclusion in the JAR.
You will find the assembled ready-to-use Jar in the `build/libs/` directory.
