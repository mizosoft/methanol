# Enhanced HttpClient

Methanol has a special `HttpClient` that extends the standard one with interesting new features.
Unsurprisingly, the client is named `Methanol`.

## Usage

In addition to [interceptors] and [caching], `Methanol` can apply default properties to your requests.
Think resolving with a base URI, adding default request headers, default timeouts, etc.
 
```java
var builder = Methanol.newBuilder()
    .cache(...)
    .interceptor(...)
    .userAgent("Will Smith")                     // Custom User-Agent
    .baseUri("https://api.github.com")           // Base URI to resolve requests' URI against
    .defaultHeader("Accept", "application/json") // Default request headers
    .requestTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))      // Default request timeout
    .readTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))          // Timeout for single reads
    .autoAcceptEncoding(true);                   // Transparent response compression, this is true by default

// Continue using as a standard HttpClient.Builder!
var client = builder.executor(...)
    .executor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(16))
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    ...
    .build();
```

You can also build from an existing `HttpClient` instance. However, you can't install an `HttpCache`
in such case.

```java
HttpClient prebuiltClient = ...
var client = Methanol.newBuilder(prebuiltClient)
    .interceptor(...)
    .userAgent("Will Smith")
     ...
    .build();

```

!!! tip
    `Methanol` is an `HttpClient`. It implements the same API like `send` & `sendAsync`, which you can
    continue using as usual.

!!! note
    Default properties don't override those the request already has. For instance, a client with a
    default `Accept: text/html` will not override a request's `Accept: application/json`.

### Transparent Compression

If `autoAcceptEncoding` is enabled, the client complements requests with an `Accept-Encoding` header
which accepts all supported encodings (i.e. available [`BodyDecoder`](decompression.md) providers). Additionally,
the response is transparently decompressed according to its `Content-Encoding`.

Since `deflate` & `gzip` are supported out of the box, they're always included in `Accept-Encoding`.
For instance, if [brotli][methanol-brotli] is installed, requests will typically have: `Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip, br`.
If you want specific encodings to be applied, add `Accept-Encoding` as a default header or explicitly
set one in your request.

=== "Default Header"

    ```java
    // Advertise brotli decompression
    var client = Methanol.newBuilder()
        .defaultHeader("Accept-Encoding", "br")
        .build();
    ```

=== "Request Header"

    ```java
    // Advertise brotli decompression
    var request = MutableRequest.GET(uri)
        .header("Accept-Encoding", "br");
    ```

### MimeBodyPublisher

`Methanol` automatically sets a request's `Content-Type` if it has a [`MimeBodyPublisher`](media_types.md#mimebodypublisher).
If the request already has a `Content-Type`, it's overwritten. This makes sense as a body knows its media type
better than a containing request mistakenly setting a different one.

### Reactive Dispatching

If you like reactive streams, use `Methanol::exchange`, which is like `sendAsync` but returns
`Publisher<HttpResponse<T>>` sources instead.

=== "Without HTTP/2 Push"

    ```java
    var client = Methanol.create();

    var request = MutableRequest.GET("https://http2-push.appspot.com/?nopush");
    var publisher = client.exchange(request, BodyHandlers.ofFile(Path.of("page.html")));

    JdkFlowAdapter.flowPublisherToFlux(publisher)
        .doOnNext(response -> System.out.printf("%s: %s", response, response.body()))
        .blockLast();
    ```

=== "With HTTP/2 Push"

    ```java
    var client = Methanol.create();

    var request = MutableRequest.GET("https://http2-push.appspot.com");
    var publisher = client.exchange(
        request, 
        BodyHandlers.ofFile(Path.of("page.html")), 
        pushPromise -> BodyHandlers.ofFile(Path.of(pushPromise.uri().getPath()).getFileName()));

    JdkFlowAdapter.flowPublisherToFlux(publisher)
        .doOnNext(response -> System.out.printf("%s: %s%n", response, response.body()))
        .blockLast();
    ```

## MutableRequest

`MutableRequest` is an `HttpRequest` that implements `HttpRequest.Builder` for settings request's
properties. This drops immutability in favor of some convenience when the request is sent immediately.

```java
var response = client.send(MutableReqeust.GET(uri), BodyHandlers.ofString());
```

Additionally, `MutableRequest` accepts relative URIs (standard `HttpRequest.Builder` doesn't). This
is a complementing feature to `Methanol`'s base URIs, against which relative ones are resolved.

!!! tip 
    You can use `MutableRequest::toImmutableRequest` to get an immutable `HttpRequest` snapshot.
