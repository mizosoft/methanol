 * of a {@link java.util.concurrent.Flow.Processor Processor}{@code <List<ByteBuffer>,
 * List<ByteBuffer>>}. It takes lists of {@code ByteBuffers} from the HTTP client, then publishes
 * their decompressed form to the {@link #downstream() downstream subscriber}, which itself converts
 * the former to the desired high-level type.
 *
 * <p>The guarantees given by the HTTP client are also given by the decoder; the downstream receives
 * a strictly ordered representation of the decoded response body in the form of immutable lists of
 * read-only {@code ByteBuffers}, which up on being passed, are no longer referenced by the decoder.
 *
 * <p>Optionally, a {@code BodyDecoder} can have an {@code Executor}. If present, the executor is
 * used to deliver downstream signals (that is, downstream's onXXXX methods are dispatched to the
 * executor). This can lead to overlapped processing between the two subscribers. If an executor is
 * not present, the decoder processes and supplies downstream items in the same thread, which is
 * normally the upstream thread supplying the compressed {@code ByteBuffers}.
